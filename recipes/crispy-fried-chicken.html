    <h3>How to Make Crispy Fried chicken</h3>
    <p>
      I experimented with lots of recipes over the years to find the best crispy
      fried chicken. This is it! It's bits and pieces of hints I have heard over
      the years. It's more a matter of preparation and cooking method!
    </p>
    <h2>ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>chicken</li>
      <li>Flour</li>
      <li>seasonings</li>
      <!-- <li>chicken</li> -->
      <li>Buttermilk</li>
      <li>Oil</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol>
      <li>Dredge the chicken</li>
      <p>
        Pour buttermilk into a shallow bowl, then dip the chicken (on both
        sides) until it's completely soaked in buttermilk. Place the soaked
        chicken in the bag with flour mixture, seal, and shake well to coat.
        Transfer the coated chicken to a baking sheet, and cover. Allow the
        flour coating to become a paste-like consistency.
      </p>
      <li>Fry the chicken</li>
      <p>
        Pour the oil in a skillet and bring it to high heat. Brown the chicken
        on both sides, then reduce the heat, cover the skillet, and cook for
        about 30 minutes. Remove the cover, return the heat to high, and fry
        until extra crispy. Drain the chicken on paper towels.
